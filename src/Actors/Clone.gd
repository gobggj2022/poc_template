# Physics process is a built-in loop in Godot.
# If you define _physics_process on a node, Godot will call it every frame.

# We use separate functions to calculate the direction and velocity to make this one easier to read.
# At a glance, you can see that the physics process loop:
# 1. Calculates the move direction.
# 2. Calculates the move velocity.
# 3. Moves the character.
# 4. Updates the sprite direction.
# 5. Shoots bullets.
# 6. Updates the animation.

# Splitting the physics process logic into functions not only makes it
# easier to read, it help to change or improve the code later on:
# - If you need to change a calculation, you can use Go To -> Function
#   (Ctrl Alt F) to quickly jump to the corresponding function.
# - If you split the character into a state machine or more advanced pattern,
#   you can easily move individual functions.
	# We use the sprite's scale to store Robiâ€™s look direction which allows us to shoot
	# bullets forward.
	# There are many situations like these where you can reuse existing properties instead of
	# creating new variables.
